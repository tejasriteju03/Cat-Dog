This computer vision project aims to classify images as either cats or dogs, employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with PyTorch. While achieving high accuracy is desirable, the primary focus lies in gaining proficiency in implementing CNNs for image classification rather than solely optimizing for accuracy.
